            <p class = "text">Hello, I'm Ram, a passionate frontend developer. I am proficient in Python, HTML, CSS, and I am currently learning MERN, Dart, Flutter, and JavaScript.
                            Being able to solve real-life problems using technology fuels my drive for the field. I have created a UPLB ICS Registration Planner using Java with the help
                            of my teammates, and a solo program that computes the optimal budget plan to reduce city pollution through simplex method using R. Currently, I am looking for a full-time
                            frontend developer role.

                            Contrary to that, my most enjoyed hobby is actually going outdoors. I love spending time in nature when I can, as it also helps me to take a break from all the digital work
                            that I do.
