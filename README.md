Create a GitHub account, create a repository, set its visibility to public. Write an index.html file along with a CSS file. Clone the repository to your local device. Add, edit, commit push changes to GitHub.
Go to the Settings tab of your repository, and then click Pages. Select Deploy from a Branch, select the branch, then click save. Wait for a few seconds, then your page is deployed and live.

I learned the existence of Flexbox through this exercise, which really helped make the process of organizing information on the site easier. There are still a lot of elements in HTML and CSS, meaning
there's so much more to explore and learn. This can make each new website that I create, better than the previous one.
